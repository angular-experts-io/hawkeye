Welcome to Hawkeye, a powerful tool designed to help developers visualize and optimize their JavaScript bundles. With
our intuitive interface, you can gain deep insights into your projectâ€™s bundle structure, identifying large modules,
dependencies, and assets that may be impacting performance.

Our visual breakdown allows you to see exactly how your code and third-party libraries contribute to the overall size of
your bundle, empowering you to make data-driven decisions to improve load times, enhance performance, and streamline
your build process.

## Setting up analyze scripts

Hawkeye is provides a `init` command to help you set up analyze scripts in your `package.json` with ease.
Simply run the following command and answer the questions from the wizard:

```bash
npx @angular-experts/hawkeye init
```

## Analyze Your Bundle with Hawkeye

From here on you can run the following commands to analyze your project:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

How it works:

1. Generating build stats: It builds the project and creates a stats.json file containing information about the bundled output. You'll find this file in your project's output directory (usually ./dist).
2. Launching an analysis server: A server starts at http://localhost:1420. 

Open it in your browser and upload the stats.json file to see a visual representation of your bundle's contents.

## Running the analyzer directly

If you already have a stats.json and like to run the analyzer directly on it, you can do so by running the following command:
```bash
npx @angular-experts/hawkeye <pathToStatsJsonFile>
```

## Version
Use the following command to print the version of Hawkeye:
```bash
npx hawkeye --version
```

## Help
For more information on using Hawkeye, including detailed command references run:
```bash
npx hawkeye --help
```
