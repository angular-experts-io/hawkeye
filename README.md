Welcome to Hawkeye, a powerful tool designed to help developers visualize and optimize their JavaScript bundles. With
our intuitive interface, you can gain deep insights into your projectâ€™s bundle structure, identifying large modules,
dependencies, and assets that may be impacting performance.

Our visual breakdown allows you to see exactly how your code and third-party libraries contribute to the overall size of
your bundle, empowering you to make data-driven decisions to improve load times, enhance performance, and streamline
your build process.

## Setting up analyze scripts
